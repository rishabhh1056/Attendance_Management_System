The Employee Management System is my first professional project, focusing on Android development. This project revolves around managing employee details, documents, attendance, and salary information. It includes three distinct dashboards: admin, employee, and client.

Admin Dashboard: The admin dashboard provides full control over managing employee data, attendance records, and salary details. Admins can perform various tasks related to employee management.

Employee Dashboard: Employees access their dashboard using unique credentials. They can view their professional details, such as salary and attendance records. However, they cannot edit any information.

Client Dashboard: The client dashboard offers insights into the company's professional works, projects, and website. Clients can learn more about the company's services and projects.

This project aims to streamline employee management processes while providing clients with a glimpse into the company's professional endeavors.
